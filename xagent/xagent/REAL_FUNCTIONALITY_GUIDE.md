  2. Analyzes search results using OpenAI
  3. Selects best site (e.g., Google Flights, Kayak, Expedia)
  4. Opens site in real browser (Chromium)
  5. Fills in: Origin, Destination, Date, Class
  6. Searches for flights
  7. Captures screenshots at each step
  8. Extracts flight details
  9. (With approval) Completes booking
    ↓
Returns to user:
  ✅ Booking confirmation
  ✅ Screenshots of process
  ✅ Flight details (real data from site)
  ✅ Stored in memory for future reference
```
