# 🧪 Testing Browser Fallback - Step by Step

## 🎯 **FIXED ARCHITECTURE**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
Frontend → Playwright ❌ (Can't run in browser!)
```

### **After (Correct):**
```
Frontend → HTTP API → Backend → Playwright ✅
```

---

## 📋 **INSTALLATION (One-Time Setup)**

### **Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies**

```bash
# In backend directory
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

**This downloads Chromium browser for automation.**

---

### **Step 2: Restart Backend**

```bash
# In backend directory
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Watch for:**
```bash
✅ Groq API key loaded
✅ OpenAI API key loaded
✅ Pinecone API key loaded
INFO: Application startup complete.
```

---

### **Step 3: Restart Frontend**

```bash
# In root directory
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 **TEST CASES**

### **Test 1: Simple Task (No Tool)**

**Open chat and type:**
```
"Find flights to London for next month"
```

**Expected Backend Logs:**
```bash
INFO: POST /api/browser-fallback/execute
🌐 FALLBACK ACTIVATED: Find flights to London for next month
🔍 Searching web for: best flight booking sites
✅ Found 10 search results
🧠 AI selected: Google Flights
🌐 Opening browser...
⚡ Executing task on site...
✅ Fallback execution completed
```

**Expected Frontend Console:**
```javascript
⚠️ Skill "search_flights" not available - ACTIVATING INTELLIGENT FALLBACK
🌐 Calling backend for browser fallback...
✅ Browser fallback completed via backend
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
"I don't have a flight booking tool yet, but no problem! 
I used my browser automation to search for you.

🔍 I searched Google and selected Google Flights (highest rated)
🌐 Opened the site and completed your search

Found 15 flights from Dubai to London departing Nov 20:

1. British Airways - $450 - Direct flight
2. Emirates - $520 - Direct flight
3. Lufthansa - $380 - 1 stop

Which one interests you? I can complete the booking for you!

💡 I learned how to use Google Flights! Would you like me to 
create an automated tool for future searches? Next time will 
be instant (2-3 seconds)!"
```

### **Test 2: Hotel Booking**

**Type:**
```
"Find me a hotel in Paris"
```

**Expected:**
- Backend uses browser automation
- Searches for booking sites
- Opens Booking.com or Hotels.com
- Presents hotel options
- Offers to create tool

---

### **Test 3: Verify Browser Opens (Watch It Work!)**

**In Backend:**

The browser should open visibly (headless=False in code).

**You should see:**
- A Chromium browser window pops up
- Google search happens automatically
- Navigation to booking site
- Forms being filled
- Results being extracted

**This is the "watch agent work" feature!** 👁️

## 🎯 **WHAT TO CHECK**

### **1. Backend Logs:**
```bash
✅ "🌐 FALLBACK ACTIVATED"
✅ "🔍 Searching web for"
✅ "✅ Browser initialized"
✅ "⚡ Executing task on site"
✅ "✅ Fallback execution completed"
```

### **2. Frontend Console:**
```javascript
✅ "ACTIVATING INTELLIGENT FALLBACK"
✅ "Calling backend for browser fallback"
✅ "Browser fallback completed"
```

### **3. Browser Window:**
```
✅ Chromium window opens
✅ Google search executes
✅ Navigation to selected site
✅ Form filling visible
✅ Results extraction
```

### **4. Agent Response:**
```
✅ Explains what it did
✅ Shows results
✅ Offers to create tool
✅ Enthusiastic tone
```

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Error: "Playwright not installed"**
```bash
cd backend
playwright install chromium
```

### **Error: "Module 'browser_fallback' not found"**
```bash
# Restart backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **Error: "Cannot connect to backend"**
```typescript
// Check backend URL in frontend
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';  // Must match backend port
```

### **No browser window opens:**
```python
# In browser_fallback_service.py, verify:
headless=False  # Should be False to see browser
```
