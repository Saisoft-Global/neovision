## 💡 **HOW LEARNING WORKS IN PRACTICE**

### **Automatic Learning Cycle:**

```
Every agent interaction:

1. QUERY COLLECTIVE (Before)
   "What have other agents learned about this?"
   ↓
   Load relevant learnings
   ↓
   Apply to current approach

2. GENERATE RESPONSE
   Enhanced with citations, journey tracking, etc.
   ↓
   Track success metrics
   ↓
   Measure confidence and time

3. EXTRACT LEARNING (After)
   AI analyzes interaction
   ↓
   Identifies pattern if significant
   ↓
   Determines applicability

4. CONTRIBUTE TO COLLECTIVE
   Store in collective_learnings
   ↓
   Available to ALL agents
   ↓
   System gets smarter!

5. UPDATE STATS
   Personal learning profile
   ↓
   System-wide metrics
```

**This happens for EVERY interaction with EVERY agent!**
