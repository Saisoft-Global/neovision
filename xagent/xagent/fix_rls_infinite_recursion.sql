-- FIX RLS INFINITE RECURSION
-- ============================================
-- This script fixes the infinite recursion in RLS policies

-- ============================================
-- 1. DROP ALL PROBLEMATIC RLS POLICIES
-- ============================================

-- Drop organization_members policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view organization members" ON public.organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create organization members" ON public.organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update organization members" ON public.organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete organization members" ON public.organization_members;

-- Drop organizations policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view accessible organizations" ON public.organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create organizations" ON public.organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update organizations" ON public.organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete organizations" ON public.organizations;

-- Drop agents policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view accessible agents" ON public.agents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create agents" ON public.agents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their accessible agents" ON public.agents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their agents" ON public.agents;

-- Drop workflows policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view accessible workflows" ON public.workflows;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create workflows" ON public.workflows;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update workflows" ON public.workflows;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete workflows" ON public.workflows;
