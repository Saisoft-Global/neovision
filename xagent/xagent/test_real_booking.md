## Debugging Tips

### If browser doesn't open:
```bash
# Check Playwright installation
playwright install chromium

# Check backend logs for errors
# Look for: "‚úÖ Playwright browser initialized"
```

### If getting mock data instead:
```bash
# Check these logs in backend:
# Should see: "üåê FALLBACK ACTIVATED: No tool available for 'task'"
# Should NOT see: "Using mock automation"

# Check frontend logs:
# Should see: "üåê Detected action-required task: booking"
# Should see: "üöÄ Triggering browser automation..."
```

### If embeddings failing:
```bash
# Check: model should be "text-embedding-ada-002"
# NOT: "text-embedding-ada-002-v2" (doesn't exist!)

# Frontend console should show:
# "üîç [EMBEDDINGS] Response status: 200" ‚úÖ
# NOT: "500 Internal Server Error" ‚ùå
```
