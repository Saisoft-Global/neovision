## 🔍 **QUICK HEALTH CHECK COMMANDS**

### **Frontend Health Check:**
```bash
# Check if app builds
npm run build

# Check for type errors
npm run type-check

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint
```

### **Backend Health Check:**
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Check if server starts
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Should see:
# ✅ Server running on http://localhost:8000
# ✅ No startup errors
```

### **Database Health Check:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Expected tables:
-- users, agents, chat_messages, documents, workflows, etc.

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- All tables should have rowsecurity = true
```

### **API Health Check:**
```bash
# Test Supabase connection
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/rest/v1/ \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Should return 200 OK

# Test backend (if running)
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue: "LLM Provider Not Configured"**
```bash
# Fix: Add OpenAI API key to .env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Or configure Ollama
VITE_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### **Issue: "Supabase Connection Failed"**
```bash
# Fix: Verify Supabase credentials
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...

# Test connection:
# Go to Supabase dashboard → Settings → API
# Copy URL and anon key
```

### **Issue: "Agent Creation Fails"**
```sql
-- Fix: Check if agents table exists
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agents (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  type text NOT NULL,
  config jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
  status text DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE agents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own agents"
  ON agents FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### **Issue: "Context Not Retained"**
```typescript
// Fix: Check if ConversationContextManager is initialized
// File: src/services/context/UnifiedContextManager.ts

// Verify constructor initializes:
this.conversationManager = ConversationContextManager.getInstance();
```
