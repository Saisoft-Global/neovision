# 🤖 Agent Action & Capability System - Complete Overview

## ✅ **YES - Your Agents CAN Invoke Actions!**

Your platform has **4 parallel systems** for agents to execute actions based on their type and configuration:

---

## 1. 🎯 Type-Specific Action Execution

Each agent type has its own `execute()` method with **specialized actions**.

### Example: HR Agent (Type: `hr`)
```typescript
// Your HR agent automatically has these actions:
- onboard_employee
- process_leave_request  
- answer_policy_questions
- schedule_interview
- generate_offer_letter
```

### Example: Productivity AI Agent (Type: `productivity`)
```typescript
async execute(action: string, params: any) {
  switch (action) {
    case 'start_autonomous_mode':
      return await this.startAutonomousMode();
    
    case 'process_email':
      return await this.processEmail(params.email);
    
    case 'schedule_meeting':
      return await this.scheduleMeeting(params);
    
    case 'create_task':
      return await this.createTask(params);
    
    case 'generate_daily_summary':
      return await this.generateDailySummary(params.emails);
    
    // 14+ more actions...
  }
}
```

### Available Agent Types:
```typescript
switch (agentType) {
  case 'email':        // EmailAgent - Process, respond, classify emails
  case 'meeting':      // MeetingAgent - Schedule, manage meetings
  case 'knowledge':    // KnowledgeAgent - Document Q&A, knowledge retrieval
  case 'task':         // TaskAgent - Create, update, analyze tasks
  case 'productivity': // ProductivityAI - Full autonomous email/task management
  case 'hr':           // HR Agent - Employee management, policies
  case 'finance':      // Finance Agent - Invoice processing, analytics
  case 'tool_enabled': // Generic agent with custom tool access
  default:             // DirectExecutionAgent - Custom chat agent
}
```

## 2. 🔧 Dynamic Tool & Skill System

Agents can use **registered tools** with multiple skills.

### Current Tools Registered:
```
✅ Email Tool (5 skills)
   ├─ parse_email
   ├─ summarize_email
   ├─ identify_critical_email
   ├─ draft_reply
   └─ classify_email

✅ CRM Tool - Salesforce (5 skills)
   ├─ query_leads
   ├─ create_lead
   ├─ update_opportunity
   ├─ analyze_pipeline
   └─ find_contacts

✅ Zoho Tool (10 skills)
   ├─ extract_invoice_data
   ├─ create_zoho_invoice
   ├─ manage_zoho_customer
   ├─ get_invoice_status
   ├─ document_to_invoice
   ├─ search_invoices
   ├─ update_invoice_status
   ├─ send_invoice_email
   ├─ get_payment_history
   └─ handle_natural_query
```

### How Agents Use Tools:

```typescript
// 1. Agent receives natural language request
"Can you create an invoice for John Doe for $5000?"

// 2. Intent analysis determines skill needed
🎯 Intent detected: create_zoho_invoice (confidence: 0.92)

// 3. Parameters extracted from prompt
{
  customer: "John Doe",
  amount: 5000,
  // ...extracted params
}

// 4. Skill executed automatically
✅ Invoice created: INV-12345
```

---

## 3. ⚙️ Workflow Triggering System

Agents can **detect and execute workflows** based on conversation context.

### How It Works:

```typescript
// User says: "Onboard Kishor Namburu as CEO from tomorrow"

// 1. WorkflowMatcher analyzes message
🔍 Checking for workflow triggers...

// 2. Finds matching workflow
🎯 Workflow matched: "Employee Onboarding" (confidence: 0.95)

// 3. Executes workflow nodes
🔄 Triggering workflow: Employee Onboarding
  ├─ Node 1: Create employee record
  ├─ Node 2: Set up email account
  ├─ Node 3: Assign equipment
  ├─ Node 4: Schedule orientation
  └─ Node 5: Send welcome email

// 4. Returns human-friendly response
✅ "I've initiated the onboarding process for Kishor Namburu..."
```

### Workflow Types:
- Employee onboarding
- Leave approval
- Invoice processing
- Lead qualification
- Meeting scheduling
- Custom workflows (you can create any!)

---

## 4. 🧠 Dynamic Capability Discovery

Agents **automatically discover** what they can do based on configuration.

### CapabilityManager Discovery Process:

```typescript
// When agent initializes:
🔍 Discovering capabilities for agent...

// 1. Get agent's skills from database
📚 Agent has 8 skills

// 2. Get attached tools
🔧 Agent has 2 tools attached

// 3. Get linked workflows  
⚙️ Agent has 3 workflows linked

// 4. Determine combined capabilities
✅ Discovered 15 capabilities

// Result: Agent knows it can:
- Understand natural language
- Execute specific skills
- Trigger workflows
- Use external tools
- Access knowledge base
- Remember conversations
```

## 🎬 Real-World Example: HR Agent in Action

### User Says: "Onboard John as Software Engineer starting Monday"

**Agent Processing Pipeline:**

```
1️⃣ RAG Context Building (~3 sec)
   ├─ Search vector DB for onboarding procedures
   ├─ Check knowledge graph for org structure
   └─ Recall past onboarding conversations

2️⃣ Workflow Detection (~500ms)
   ├─ WorkflowMatcher analyzes intent
   ├─ Matches "Employee Onboarding" workflow
   └─ Confidence: 0.94

3️⃣ Workflow Execution (~2-5 sec)
   ├─ Extract data: name="John", role="Software Engineer", date="Monday"
   ├─ Node 1: Create employee record in Supabase
   ├─ Node 2: Call HR system API to create account
   ├─ Node 3: Send equipment request to IT
   ├─ Node 4: Schedule orientation meeting
   └─ Node 5: Send welcome email

4️⃣ Response Generation (~15 sec for GPT-4)
   ├─ Build context-aware response
   └─ Include workflow results

5️⃣ Memory Storage (background)
   └─ Store interaction for future reference
```

**Agent Response:**
```
"I've started the onboarding process for John as a Software Engineer 
beginning Monday. Here's what I've done:

✅ Created employee profile
✅ Initiated account setup
✅ Requested laptop and equipment
✅ Scheduled orientation for Monday 9 AM
✅ Sent welcome package via email

Is there anything else you'd like me to add to John's onboarding?"
```

## 🔄 How to Enable New Actions

### Method 1: Add Skills to Agent

```sql
-- In Supabase, add skills to your agent:
INSERT INTO agent_skills (agent_id, skill_name, skill_level)
VALUES 
  ('your-agent-id', 'send_email', 3),
  ('your-agent-id', 'create_calendar_event', 2);
```

### Method 2: Attach Tools

```typescript
// Tools are registered globally and agents can access them
// Check: src/services/tools/ToolRegistry.ts

// To add a new tool:
1. Create tool class (extends BaseTool)
2. Register in ToolRegistry  
3. Attach to agent via database
```

### Method 3: Link Workflows

```sql
-- Link workflow to agent:
INSERT INTO agent_workflows (agent_id, workflow_id)
VALUES ('your-agent-id', 'workflow-id');
```

### Method 4: Create Custom Agent Type

```typescript
// Create new agent class:
export class CustomAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async execute(action: string, params: any) {
    switch (action) {
      case 'custom_action':
        return await this.doCustomThing(params);
      // ... more actions
    }
  }
}

// Register in AgentFactory
```

## 🧪 Testing Agent Actions

### Via Chat Interface:
```
User: "Create invoice for Acme Corp for $10,000"

Expected:
✅ Agent detects create_zoho_invoice skill
✅ Extracts parameters
✅ Executes Zoho API call
✅ Returns confirmation with invoice number
```

### Via Direct API:
```typescript
const result = await agent.execute('create_task', {
  title: 'Review proposal',
  priority: 'high',
  dueDate: '2025-10-20'
});
```

---

## 📈 Capability Visibility

### Check Agent Capabilities:

```typescript
// In browser console:
const agent = agentFactory.getAgentInstance('agent-id');
await agent.initialize();

// View all capabilities:
console.log(agent.getCapabilityReport());

// Check specific skill:
console.log(agent.hasSkill('send_email'));  // true/false
```
