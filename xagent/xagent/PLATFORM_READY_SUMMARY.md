## ⚠️ Critical Fix Needed (6-8 hours)

### Issue: User Isolation Not Enforced

**Problem**: Agents table lacks `user_id` column, so users can potentially see each other's agents.

**Solution**: Already created for you! ✅

#### Files Created:
1. ✅ `supabase/migrations/20250112000000_add_user_ownership.sql`
2. ✅ `src/services/agent/AgentFactory.ts` (updated)

#### What It Does:
- Adds `user_id` column to agents table
- Updates RLS policies for user isolation
- Ensures users only see their own agents
- Includes user_id when creating agents
- Admins can see all agents

---

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option 2: Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor
# Run: supabase/migrations/20250112000000_add_user_ownership.sql
```

### Step 2: Restart Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test

```typescript
// Create agent as User A
// Login as User B
// User B should NOT see User A's agent
// Admin should see all agents
```
