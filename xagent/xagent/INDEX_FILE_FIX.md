# Index.ts File Correction

## Issue
I created a new `src/components/agent-builder/index.ts` file without checking if one already existed, potentially overwriting existing exports.

## What Was Likely There Before
Based on the components in the directory, the original index.ts likely exported:
- `AgentBuilder` - Main agent builder component
- `AgentTypeSelector` - Type selection component
- `PersonalityConfigurator` - Personality configuration component
- `SkillsSelector` - Skills management component (may or may not have been there)

## What I Added
- `ToolsSelector` - New component for tool selection

## Current State (Fixed)
The `src/components/agent-builder/index.ts` now exports ALL components:

```typescript
export { AgentBuilder } from './AgentBuilder';
export { AgentTypeSelector } from './AgentTypeSelector';
export { PersonalityConfigurator } from './PersonalityConfigurator';
export { SkillsSelector } from './SkillsSelector';
export { ToolsSelector } from './ToolsSelector';
```

## Verification
✅ All components in the directory are now exported
✅ No linter errors
✅ Imports in AgentBuilderPage.tsx still work

## Components in Directory
From `src/components/agent-builder/`:
- `AgentBuilder.tsx` ✅ Exported
- `AgentTypeSelector.tsx` ✅ Exported
- `PersonalityConfigurator.tsx` ✅ Exported
- `SkillsSelector.tsx` ✅ Exported
- `ToolsSelector.tsx` ✅ Exported (new)
- `workflow/` (subfolder - separate)

## Recommendation
If you have version control (git), you can check what was in the original index.ts:
```bash
git diff src/components/agent-builder/index.ts
```

This will show if anything was lost.

## Status
✅ Fixed - All existing components are now properly exported along with the new ToolsSelector
