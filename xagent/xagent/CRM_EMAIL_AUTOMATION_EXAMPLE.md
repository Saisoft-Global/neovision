### **Step 1: Email Received**
```
From: john.smith@abccorp.com
To: sales@yourcompany.com
Subject: Interested in Premium Package
Content: 
Hi there,

I'm John Smith from ABC Corp. We're looking for a premium software package 
for our team of 50 users. Our budget is around $50,000 and we need to 
implement this by Q2. 

Can you schedule a demo for next week? My phone is (555) 123-4567.

```

### **Step 2: User Prompt to AI Agent**
```
User: "Process this email and create a CRM lead"
```

### **Step 3: AI Agent Processing**
The `CRMEmailAgent` analyzes the email and extracts:

```json
{
  "action": "create_lead",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "extractedData": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@abccorp.com",
    "company": "ABC Corp",
    "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
    "status": "hot",
    "source": "email",
    "notes": "Interested in premium package for 50 users, budget $50,000, needs demo next week, Q2 implementation",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: CRM API Call**
The agent automatically calls your CRM API:

```javascript
// POST /api/leads
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@abccorp.com",
  "company": "ABC Corp",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "leadStatus": "hot",
  "leadSource": "email",
  "description": "Interested in premium package for 50 users, budget $50,000, needs demo next week, Q2 implementation",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

### **Step 5: Additional Actions Triggered**
Based on the email content, the AI also:

1. **Creates Opportunity**: $50,000 deal for premium package
2. **Schedules Follow-up**: Demo request for next week
3. **Sets Task**: Prepare demo materials for ABC Corp
